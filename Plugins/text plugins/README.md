This is just a quick proof of concept to use JS generated CSS text shadows, and animate them based on the cursor's distance from the center point. Oddly enough, it doesn't use trigonometry. It's just a simple mux. Count X, then Count Y, Then do some simple math based on those points. Badabing, badaboom.
